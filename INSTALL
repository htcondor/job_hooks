The Condor job hooks will first look for their configuration in condor's
configuration files.  The following parameters can be placed in a condor
configuration file to configure the job hooks:

JOB_HOOKS_IP:
   Type: IP Address
   Desc: The IP address of a translation daemon

JOB_HOOKS_PORT:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The port on JOB_HOOKS_IP the translation daemon is listening
         for connections

If the configuration is not found in condor's configuration files, then
the job hooks will look in /etc/condor/job-hooks.conf.
